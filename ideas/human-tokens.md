# Human Tokens

**What:** A platform where humans launch tokens that represent themselves—not their content or community, but their reputation and commitment to building. Self verification ensures only real humans can create tokens and participate in early trading, eliminating bot exploitation. Token creators earn fees on all trades while gaining market visibility to grow their projects. The platform enables humans to make public commitments through onchain prediction markets tied to verifiable goals (transactions, user metrics, milestones), creating accountability and allowing their community to bet on their success. Built with uniswap hooks for preferential fees to verified humans, ERC8021 for transaction attribution, and verifiable computation for proving offchain metrics onchain.

**Why:** Most tokens today rally around content, memes, or narratives—disconnected from the humans actually building. This creates a mismatch: humans need reputation and sustainable funding, but token launches favor speculators and bots who extract value without contribution. Human tokens flip this: they're reputation primitives that let humans put skin in the game, make verifiable commitments, and build in public while their supporters share in the upside. Fair launches become actually fair when only verified humans can participate. Goal-based prediction markets transform vague "building in public" into concrete, tradeable commitments with real consequences—aligning incentives between humans and believers for long-term value creation rather than quick pumps.

**Thin slice:** Single-page dapp where a Self-verified user can (1) create their personal token with a basic bonding curve, (2) set one public goal with a deadline (e.g., "ship 100 transactions to my protocol by Dec 31"), and (3) enable others to buy/sell positions on whether they'll hit it. Winner-take-all prediction market with simple binary outcome.
